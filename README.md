Fuzzy Risk Web is an open source application for analysing impact of risks on Global Production Networks (GPNs) developed at Coventry University (UK). It can be used in strategic decision making on alternative GPN configurations and their susceptibility to risk.

Fuzzy Risk Lab includes the following functionality:

To define risk factors relevant to a GPN, including a risk description, risk category (Supply, Production, Logistics, Demand, Information and Control, or External), zone of influence, company history related to the risk and mitigation methods applied,
To define the GPN including its nodes and interdependencies between the nodes,
To define risk scenarios, defined by GPN disturbances, durations and likelihood of their occurrences,
To calculate the risk impact on the GPN expressed via GPN nodes inoperability and total economic loss of risk. This calculation is based on a Fuzzy Dynamic Inoperability Input Output model. GPN parameters’ values and confidence in these values are uncertain and are specified using linguistic values such as Very Low, Low, Mildly Low, Medium, Mildly High, High and Very High.
To analyse the sensitivity of the model outputs (GPN nodes inoperability and total economic loss of risk) on changes in GPN parameters’ values,
-To analyse the sensitivity of the outputs on the uncertainty in the GPN parameters.
